# 
# Track a TC or precursor vortex using an object-based algorithm, following
#   Davis et al. (2006, MWR) and Rios-Berrios et al. (2018, JAS).
# 
# The sell of this approach is that any 2D variable (vorticity, MSLP, precip)
#   can be used as input.
# 
# Steps:
#   1) Large-scale smoothing XXX in time and space.
#   2) Top-5% of variable is retained.
#   3) Centroid is found via weighted integral approach.
#  xxx 4) Sanity check for maximum possible phase speed for continuity.
# 
# Input:
#   f   = input variable assumed to be in form f = f(t,x,y)
#   lon = longitude points (deg) as lon = lon(x)
#   lat = longitude points (deg) as lat = lat(y)
#  
# Returns: numpy array[itrack,2] where itrack corresponds to (potentially)
#   multiple identified tracks and the second dimension is (lon,lat).
